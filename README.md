### UI-Static (AKA the **Player**)
~~The intention is that UI-Static is the first main task of this project and largely serves as a prototype.~~ Currently the plan is to release UI-Static as the main program, with releases for the primary platforms (Win, Linux, Mac) and the mixer just sends a zip file of the music and metadata files which is loaded into the player.
