Based on an idea from someone on Tumblr.

Pronounced "Ker-th-ow Pod".

Name comes from the Welsh for music "cerddoriaeth" (Ker-th-or-ee-aeth) and pod, for well, pod.

## Terms
- Mixer = person who made a mix file
- Listener = person receiving and listening to a mix file
- MixFile = compressed file containing the music files, .mpdata file ~~and optionally a UI-Portable program~~ and .mpview file

### UI-Static (AKA the **Player**)
~~The intention is that UI-Static is the first main task of this project and largely serves as a prototype.~~ Currently the plan is to release UI-Static as the main program, with releases for the primary platforms (Win, Linux, Mac) and the mixer just sends a zip file of the music and metadata files which is loaded into the player.
